        To use bundler with a Sinatra application, you only need to do two things. First, create a Gemfile.
      :code
        # lang: ruby
        gem 'sinatra'

        Then, set up your config.ru file to load the bundle before it loads your Sinatra app.
      :code
        # lang: ruby
        require 'rubygems'
        require 'bundler'

        Bundler.require

        require './my_sinatra_app'
        run MySinatraApp

        Start your development server with rackup, and Sinatra will be loaded via Bundler.
      :code
        $ bundle exec rackup

      .description
        If you run the above command and receive a 'command not found' error
        Ensure you have a bin folder in your projects root directory
        Check to see that there is a file named 'rackup' within that folder
        If you notice the file is not there run the following command:
      :code
        $ bundle install --binstubs
      .description
        This will install the executables needed for bundle exec
        Attempt to rerun the following:
      :code
        $ bundle exec rackup
      .description
        The code should no longer produce the error and your development server will be up and running
